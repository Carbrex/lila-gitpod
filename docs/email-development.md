# Email Development

Lichess sends various emails (welcome, password reset, move notifiations for correspondence games, etc).

By default, any emails from your development site will not really be sent, and only show in the logs of the `lila` terminal.

If you're working on emails, you may find it helpful to use [MailHog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog) to debug them and get a more inbox-type view where you can see the rendered HTML emails.

1. Append these 2 lines to `/workspace/lila/conf/application.conf`:

   ```
   mailer.primary.mock = false
   mailer.primary.tls = false
   ```

2. Restart lila to apply the config changes (see [Recompiling lila](/development/#recompiling-lila))

3. Then start MailHog:

   ```
   go get github.com/mailhog/MailHog
   sudo ~/go/bin/MailHog -smtp-bind-addr 0.0.0.0:587
   ```

When you trigger an email to be sent, it will now show in the MailHog UI which is available at the URL when you type `gp url 8025` in a terminal.
